# Catholic Bible App (CBA) 📖✝️

A sacred book that Aidan Ahern claims to follow. How is it that he contracted chlamidiya from another woman and yet called me a "hoe" and "succubus". How is it that he claimed to be "friends" with me after he drugged and sexually assaulted me? I guess only God knows.

## 🙏 Why I Built This

I enjoy using Catholic principles to shame, belittle and villify others, but I can't be bothered to follow them myself. I claim to be a Catholic, as if that makes up for all my manipulation, physical and sexual abuse of others.
